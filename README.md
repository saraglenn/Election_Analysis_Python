## Project Overview 
The following calculations were made as requested by the California Board of Elections regarding the congressional election audit:

1. Calculate total number of votes. 
2. Get list of candidates who received votes. 
3. Calculate total number of votes each candidate received. 
4. Calculate percentage of votes each candidate won. 
5. Determine the winner of the election. 
6. Determine the county with the largest turnout.
7. Determine the vote count for each county. 
8. Determine the percentage of votes for each county.

The purpose of this audit is to provide the California Board of Elections with a breakdwon of the congressional election as it relates to voters, individual candidates, and specific counties. Understanding the election results at this level of details allows officials to better understand their constituents related to individual communities and the geography of voting precincts.

## Audit Code Summary
This code can be used to analyze the election results of future elections. Minor modifications will allow the user to gather information regarding the number of votes cast, percentages, county level breakdown, and voter turnout. Understanding how to manipulate this code in for additional analysis will save both time and money in the event that furhter analysis is needed and/or new results need to be better understood.
